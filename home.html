      <p>Another <span>"subdivision"</span> of Legacy Roleplay - Gurkha.</p>
      <p>Legacy Roleplay is an English community founded in early 2018. We have been asked to create a subdivision aimed at players from Nepal, as we are open and intrigued by new possibilities and opportunities.</p>
      <p>This "subdivision" of Legacy is owned by the main community but is fully managed and controlled by others.</p>
      <p>We hope this allows for a better and more enjoyable experience for the Nepali part of our community, and provides a better environment for role play and growth.</p>
      <p>FiveM servers are still hosted by the main community. This discord is also owned by the main community but is controlled by another person.</p>
      <p>The FiveM server database is not synchronized between the main server and this division.</p>
